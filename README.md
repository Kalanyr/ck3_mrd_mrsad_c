# More (Religious or Immersive) Doctrines - Updated by Polytheism Reborn + More Tenet Slots and Doctrines (Stand Alone) Compatch for Crusader Kings III 1.8.1 
aka More Doctrines (updated) + MTAD (SA) Compatch aka k_mrd_mrsad_c aka ck3_mrd_mrsad_compatch 

This mod is a compatibiliy patch / compatch between  <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2863881219" target="_blank">**More Religious Doctrines - Updated by Polytheism Reborn**</a> / <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2863881058" target="_blank">**More Immersive Doctrines - Updated by Polytheism Reborn**</a>   and  <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2866697794" target="_blank">**More Tenet Slots and Doctrines**</a> /  <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2871344570" target="_blank">**MTSAD Stand Alone**</a>

This is not compatible (at least for now) with the Combined Mod because the included Diety Doctrines mod is not compatible with the More Doctrines mods (some doctrines have the same variable names). 

The Load Order is
More Religious Doctrines - Updated by Polytheism Reborn / More Immersive Doctrines - Updated by Polytheism Reborn
More Tenet Slots and Doctrines / MTSAD Stand Alone
Compatch

While I cannot guarantee compatibility, any mods that alter doctrines found in the non-modded game should be loaded after the More Doctrines mods.
